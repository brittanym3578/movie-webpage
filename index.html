    <p>As we all know, all good things must come to an end. The Tom and Jerry we all know and love have kids and pass on the shenanigans that we've all enjoyed watching. In this movie, you will enjoy twice the thrills, encounter twice the suspense, and feel
      twice the love. The next generation will have a brand new version of the Tom and Jerry we all know and love and grew up with. <span class="brown">THE LEGACY CONTINUES! </span> </p>
